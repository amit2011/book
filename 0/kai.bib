  abstract = {There is considerable interest in the simulation of systems where humans move around, for example for traffic or pedestrian simulations. Any such simulation consists of two layers: the simulation of the ``physical'' system, which includes effects such as interaction with other agents or the environment; and the simulation of the ``mental'' layer, which generates strategies of the agents. The traditional way to couple the modules is to use files. The disadvantage of that approach is twofold: The computational performance is limited by I/O; and the modules can only be run sequentially. In order to overcome these problems without sacrificing modularity, a messagebased approach is presented. Agent strategies are sent via messages to the simulation of the physical system, which executes them and sends back performance information in the form of ``events''. The strategic modules listen to these events, memorize them in some appropriate way, and possibly generate revised strategies. These strategies are sent to the simulation of the physical system immediately, so that the representation of the agent in the physical system will switch to the new strategy right away. In addition, the same messages can also be used to plug helper modules, such as viewers or recorders, into the system. An implementation of the framework is tested within our project, which explores the feasibility of using autonomous agent modeling to evaluate future scenarios in a tourist landscape in the Swiss Alps.},

  abstract = {From the point of view of a physicist, cars on a highway or pedestrians in a mall are many particle systems. Yet, the particles of those systems are more complicated than typical particles in physical systems. A question therefore is in how far the methods from physics can be applied to systems with these more complicated particles. It turns out that in fact quite a lot can be explained with the methods from physics, which combine simple microscopic modeling assumptions with advanced mathematics and/or advanced computational science. For example, those systems display a surprising variety of states, such as jammed, laminar, or oscillating. Those states can be explained using several concepts, from microscopic to uid-dynamical. Physics methods have contributed signi=0Ccantly to better understanding those states, and to alleviate them where possible.},

  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {2003},
  editor = {Bovy, P. {et al}},

  abstract = {There is discussion if traffc displays spontaneous breakdown. This paper presents computational evidence that stochastic car following models can have a control parameter that moves the model between displaying and not displaying spontaneous phase separation for some densities. Those phases can be called "laminar" and "jammed". Models with spontaneous phase separation show three states as a function of density: a first state at low density, where those models are homogeneously laminar; a second state at high density, where they are homogeneously jammed; and a third state at intermediate density, where they consist of a mix between the two phases (phase coexistence). This is the same picture as for a gas-liquid transition when volume of the gas is the control parameter. Although the gas-liquid analogy to traffc models has been widely discussed, no traffc-related model so far displayed a completely understood stochastic version of that transition. Having a stochastic model is important to understand the potentially probabilistic nature of the transition. Most importantly, if indeed models with spontaneous phase separation describe certain aspects correctly, then this leads to an understanding of spontaneous breakdown. Alternatively, if models without spontaneous phase separation describe these aspects better, then there is no spontaneous breakdown (= no breakdown without a reason). Interestingly, even models without spontaneous phase separation can still allow for jam formation on small scales, which may give the impression of having a model with spontaneous phase separation. },
