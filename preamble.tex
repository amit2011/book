%% This is an example for writing a paper at the IVT.
%% It supports english and german language.
%% By using it, it is possible to convert a paper layout into another
%% one. (i.e. working paper style into TRB style)
%%
%% The easiest way to write you own paper is to create an
%% appropriate directory stucture in ivt/documents/papers
%% i.e. ivt/doc/papers/strc/2007/mypaper,
%% copy this example into it, change the name of the file (i.e. mypaper.tex),
%% change the entries and add your own
%% latex files via "\include{mylatexfile1}" etc.
%%
%% Each keyword is documented. Just follow the instructions...
%% Enjoy!

%% hierachy path to "papers" directory
%% Example:
%%   This file is located in
%%     ivt/documents/papers/exampleConference/2007/example/example.tex
%%   by going up the directory tree four steps, you end up in the
%%   "papers" directory. Therefore \mypath need to define three times
%%   "../" ==> \newcommand{\mypath}{../../../}
%% Note:
%%   If you put your paper in an appropiate directory
%%   (papers/[Conference]/[Year]/[mypaper]/[mypaper].tex)
%%   then you do not need to change the path

%% language specification:
%%   Here you define in which langugage your paper will be written.
%%   There are ALWAYS 2 languages to define (even you do not need it.)
%%   Since we are writing only in german or english, other languages
%%   are not supported.
%%   Choose either 'german' or 'english' as your first language.

%% Include Paper-Layout:

%%   For changing this paper into i.e. TRB layout just change "ivt-wp"
