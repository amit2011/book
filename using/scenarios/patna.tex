Patna is a medium-size city in eastern India. As in other developing nations, traffic conditions are heterogeneous, composed of: a large number of bikes (37\,\%, including 4\,\% cycle rickshaws) and motorbikes (14\,\%). When this scenario was composed, public transport accounted for 18\,\% and walk for 29\,\%; only 2\,\% of all trips were made by car. Therefore, the \gls{matsim} queue simulation was modified to simulate travel demand under mixed traffic conditions.

The Patna scenario was created using household survey data from a comprehensive Patna mobility plan \citep[][]{TrippItransVks2009PatnaReport}, using the area within the Patna Municipal Corporation. The scenario consisted of 72\,zones, with a population of about 1.57\,million (year 2008), \gls{matsim} demand was generated using trip diaries., with car, motorbike and bike used as main congested modes (Figure~\ref{fig:patna0}). Passenger car units for vehicles were derived using effective area occupied by vehicles. To allow overtaking of slower vehicles (bike), by faster vehicles (car and motorbike), pre-existing, state-of-the-art \gls{fifo} queue simulation was overridden using earliest link exit time as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:patna1}. A detailed scenario description can be found in \citet[][]{AgarwalEtcMixedTraffic}.

Behavior of traffic in modified queue simulation was then analyzed by plotting fundamental diagrams and space time trajectories for car, motorbike and bike.

\ah{Could you please elaborate a little on computation time issue, i.e.,\,mention that there are none, if so.}
