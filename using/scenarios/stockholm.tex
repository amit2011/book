The Stockholm scenario was created as a student project at TU Berlin in summer, 2014. 
Because several groups worked on the project, the common base was a census data synthetic population, an \gls{osm}-based network and counts data.

The network was taken from \gls{osm} 2013~data. 
Within the city, all roads were used; in outlying regions, only mayor roads were included in the network. 
Demand consisted of home-work-home-plans only. 
The population sample size was---depending on the student group---between 1 and 5\,\%. Agents used car and (pseudo) public transit.

Count data for the morning peak along a mayor road, the E4, was used to calibrate the scenario. 
This calibration was handled differently by the groups; some just added traffic, others tried to imitate the Stockholm toll. 
Further scenario documentation is available in German.
