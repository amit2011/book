The Stockholm scenario was created as a student project at TU Berlin in Summer 2014. As several groups worked on the project, the common base are a synthetic population from census data, an \gls{osm} based network and counts data.

The network is taken from \gls{osm} data in 2013. Within the city, all roads are used, whereas in outlying regions only mayor roads are part of the network. The demand consists of home-work-home-plans only. The population sample size is---depending on the student group---between 1 and 5\,\%. Agents are using car and (pseudo) public transit.

Count data for the morning peak along a mayor road, the E4, was used to calibrate the scenario. This calibration was handled differently by the groups; some just added traffic, others tried to imitate the Stockholm toll. Further documentation about the scenario is available in German language.
