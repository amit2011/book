A \acrshort{matsim} model of the Seattle region -- more precisely of the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) area -- was developed during a sabbatical stay of K.\ Nagel with the UrbanSim team in Seattle in 2008.  The model resulted from a prototypical integration of the UrbanSim software \cite[e.g.][]{WaddellEtc2003UrbanSim} with \acrshort{matsim}. 

The base was an existing PSRC UrbanSim model, which used an existing EMME/2 model \kai{citation!} as a travel model.  It was investigated how difficult it would be to replace the EMME/2 model by \acrshort{matsim}.

The network was taken by conversion from the existing EMME network, resulting in 15478~links and 5025~nodes with attributes length, free speed, and capacity.

The demand was generated as output from UrbanSim.  Evidently, the UrbanSim simulation already contained a full synthetic population of the area.  The UrbanSim model was also set up with workplace choice, so that each synthetic person with status ``working'' had a workplace assigned.  Since that version of UrbanSim worked on the parcel level, this meant that home-to-work trips could be extracted directly, with coordinates, from the model.  As so often for initial \acrshort{matsim} studies, this home-to-work demand was completed into home-work-home plans.

The configuration used the standard \acrshort{matsim} scoring parameters, a workplace opening time of 07:00:00, and a latest work start time of 09:00:00.  The iterations were run with re-routing and time mutation enabled until convergence.  Since this was an exercise in rapid prototyping, only a 1\% sample of the full synthetic population was used; the flow and storage capacities of the road network were scaled down accordingly.  Figure~\ref{fig:seattle-snapsho}~(left) shows a result.  Figure~\ref{fig:seattle-snapsho}~(right) shows households most affected by a hypothetical closure of the Alaskan Way viaduct, which bypasses the Seattle downtown area on the waterfront side to the west.
