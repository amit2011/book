A \gls{matsim} model of the Seattle region---more precisely of the \gls{psrc} area---was developed during a sabbatical stay of K.\ Nagel with the \gls{urbansim} team in Seattle in 2008. The model resulted from a prototypical integration of the \gls{urbansim} software \citep[e.g.,][]{WaddellEtc2003UrbanSim} with \gls{matsim}. 

The base was an existing \gls{psrc} \gls{urbansim} model, which used an existing \gls{emme2} model 
%\kai{citation!} \ah{Etwa so? \citep[][]{RolleEtAl_ITE_2007, EMME_Webpage_2008}} \kai{Ja danke.  ausser dass ich das Rolle paper nicht kenne; hoffe, es geht Ã¼ber emme :-)} 
as a travel model. It was investigated how difficult it would be to replace the \gls{emme2} model by \gls{matsim}. 

The network was taken by conversion from the existing \gls{emme} network, resulting in 15\,478\,links and 5\,025\,nodes with attributes length, free speed, and capacity.

The demand was generated as output from \gls{urbansim}. Evidently, the \gls{urbansim} simulation already contained a full synthetic population of the area. The \gls{urbansim} model was also set up with workplace choice, so that each synthetic person with status "working" had a workplace assigned. Since that version of \gls{urbansim} worked on the parcel level, this meant that home-to-work trips could be extracted directly, with coordinates, from the model. As so often for initial \gls{matsim}  studies, this home-to-work demand was completed into home-work-home plans.

The configuration used the standard \gls{matsim} scoring parameters, a workplace opening time of 7\,am, and a latest work start time of 9\,am. The iterations were run with re-routing and time mutation enabled until convergence. Since this was an exercise in rapid prototyping, only a 1\,\% sample of the full synthetic population was used; the flow and storage capacities of the road network were scaled down accordingly. Figure~\ref{fig:seattle-snapshot.left} shows a result. Figure~\ref{fig:seattle-snapshot.right} shows households most affected by a hypothetical closure of the Alaskan Way viaduct, which bypasses the Seattle downtown area on the waterfront side to the west.
