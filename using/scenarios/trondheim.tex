In Institute of Transport Economics (TØI) has in cooperation with Julia Kern from TU-Berlin and Frederik Bockemühl from Hasselts University build a first prototype model for the region of Trondheim \citep[][]{FluegelKern_unpub_WTS_2014}.

The road network data was imported from a publicly accessible data bank (Elveg). Figure~\ref{fig:trondheimnetwork} illustrates the network.

Most required link information could directly be inferred from the data bank. The lane capacity (vehicles per hour) was assumed to be a flat 1\,800 per lane. Existing toll stations with their current toll structures were coded manually in the network file. The PT network is not implemented yet. The same applies to walk/cycle. Agents that take one of these modes are "teleported" with travel times being calculated with predefined speeds per transport mode. 
The initial demand is derived from the travel diaries from the National Travel Survey (NTS 2009). 4\'453 respondents are simply scaled up to 191\,676 agents; activity locations and departure times were randomized a bit to avoid "clusters". The current model differentiates only between work and "other" activities. Desirable working hours were specified to be 8\,hours. The demand consists only of private cars (no trucks). 

Standard utility functions were applied but in the calibration process, the default values for disutility from travel times in different transport modes were adjusted such that the model would reproduce the observed market shares. The fit of simulated traffic (in the reference scenario) against real-world counts was deemed satisfactory for the purpose of a first implementation \citep[][]{Bockemuehl_TechRep_UH_2014}. 

The standard behavioral modules in MATSim were included in the Trondheim model. That is, agent could react to policy measures by three choice dimensions: changing route, changing transport mode and changing departure time. To test if MATSim predicts reasonable behavioral changes, a small case study was performed. Additional tolls on streets (bridges and tunnels) to Trondheim city center were coded in the network and three congestion price structure were tested. Figure~\ref{fig:loadcurve} illustrates the effects on the simulated cars entering and leaving Trondheim city center.

Compared to the reference scenario without tolls, the total number of cars is reduced in all toll scenarios. Some agents change transport modes and some agents that would otherwise have driven through Trondheim center, change their route. Comparing the three different congestion-pricing structures, it is also evident that agents change departure time. The difference between the 15 NOK flat scenario and the 10/20 NOK scenario is small while the effect in the 50\,NOK rush scenario is substantial. Actually, in this scenario traffic is higher before 15:00 and after 17:00 implying that many agents change departure time to avoid high congestion pricing.
