The Zürich scenario is probably the most used scenario in MATSim community. Its base is the Switzerland scenario described above. The Zürich scenario, however, is the more detailed scenario; it is enhanced by data only available for the smaller region, e.g., traffic light data or freight demand data is only included for Zürich city and canton respectively. It is under continuous development, calibration and validation. It has been applied in numerous projects and and serves as a real-world example for research.   

\citet{HorniEtAl_TechRep_IVT_2011_a} provides a technical overview of the first branch of the scenario. \citet[][]{BalmerEtAl_ResRep_bdktzrh_2009} describes its generation in the context of the project ``Westumfahrung.

\paragraph{Study area:}
The Zurich base scenario is a cut-out from the Switzerland scenario described above. The study area is delineated by a circle with a 30~km radius around Bellevue, a central and prominent location in Zürich. This delineation leads to two version, namely the \emph{Zürich diluted scenario} and the \emph{Zürich cut scenario}. For the first one, all agents crossing the study area in the simulated day are considered (Figure \ref{fig:zurichScenario}), which results in almost 2 million agents. For the second, only the agents staying within this area are modeled. The \emph{Zürich cut scenario} has been used in an experimental manner only in \citet[][]{Hackney_PhDThesis_2009}. It is thus recommended to use the \emph{Zurich diluted scenario} for production runs.

\paragraph{Population and demand generation:}
Demand is directly taken from the Swiss model. Additionally, freight traffic has been added to the Zürich scenario as follows. Canton Zurich raw data for freight traffic is taken from the \emph{KVM} (Kantonales Verkehrsmodell) provided by \citet{AMV_Webpage_2011} and documented in \citet[][]{GottardiBuergler_SV_1999}. Matrices given at zonal level are disaggregated to single MATSim plans \citep[][]{ShahM_TechRep_IVT_2010}. Matrices for small delivery trucks and heavy trucks are combined into one activity called \emph{freight}. An additional 180'000 agents are generated for the Zürich region.

\paragraph{Activity Locations:} 
For the diluted Zürich scenario all Swiss facilities as described above are used.

% --------
\paragraph{Network:} 
For the diluted scenario, the networks are not thinned out. For the public transport simulation a network from the \emph{KVM} (Kantonales Verkehrsmodell Zürich) as provided by \citet[][]{AMV_Webpage_2011} is used.

\paragraph{Modes:}
The scenario simulates car and recently also public transport. Public transport schedules are derived from the KVM ZH. The modes walk and bike are ``teleported''. 

% --------
\paragraph{Calibration and validation:}
Calibration is mainly done for modal split and distance distributions. Utility function values are set accordingly.

For validation, count data on city level, cantonal level and national level \citep[][]{ASTRA_Webpage_2006} are available from various sources  resulting in 123 links measured for the inner city of Zürich delineated by a 12~km radius around Bellevue. The reduced radius of count analysis is applied to reduce boundary effects given by the reduction of demand considered outside the 30~km radius study area. An average working day (Monday to Thursday, excluding public holidays) is used for comparisons in current scenarios.

\paragraph{Miscellaneous, important to mention:}
Traffic signal data are available for the city of Zürich \citep[][]{STAPOZH-DAV_unpub_gtZH_2008}. They have been integrated for the project Westumfahrung.
